# React Books List

Developing a Mini-Book Store which will have a list of books on the side and user upon clicking the an item will be able to see the details of that book such as description, image, url to buy and price as well.

## Using a combination of React and Redux
This application is created using the combination of React as well as Redux. You might be wondering if Redux was necessay for a small project like this. Well, certainly not since it has barely 2-4 functions involved but planning to scale up to gain more Redux experience. 

### Future Features?
Would love to add more functionalities such as a Chatbot helping the user to find an appropriate list and also planning to integrate an API (not sure if exists) to show a wide variety of Books list and SearchBar
Adding filters to find appropriate book
Using Tags and Suffle.js to provide books with specific Genre
